      # Upgrades a WebSocket request and establishes the connection.
      #
      # When a connection is established it's added to the `ConnectionPool`
      # singleton, which is responsible for reading from the socket.
      #
      # Each connection is created with a digest, created from the connection
      # id (passed through the request) and the key (stored in the session).
      # Because the connection id is unique to each request, each digest is
      # valid for the lifetime of a connection. Browsing to a new page, for
      # instance, would create a new connection with a unique digest.
      #
      # This allows channel subscriptions created for a connection to be trusted
      # when the connection is ultimately established, because if either the id
      # or key is incorrect, the digest will not match and the connection will
      # not be properly identified and won't receive messages.
      #
      # Doing this essentially guarantee that the connection is established for
      # the same session the channel subscriptions were initially created for.
