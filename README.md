# Pakyow Web Framework [![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/pakyow/chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/pakyow/chat)

Pakyow lets you build modern websites and web applications that don't break the web.

It provides features such as auto-updating views while embracing traditional
concepts like progressive enhancement. Designed to be as simple as possible, it
helps you quickly create momentum and maintain it throughout a project.

## Realtime UIs

Pakyow automatically keeps your presentation layer in sync with state of the server.
Works out of the box.

## Quick & Easy Prototypes

Create a working prototype of your project with plain HTML. Later, build right on
top of the prototype without throwing it out.

## Building a Friendlier Web

We think that a simpler web leads to a democratic web. Pakyow optimizes for
simplicity, making it easier to start and leading to long-term productivity.
