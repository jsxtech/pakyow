Pakyow prioritizes user trust by waiting on the server to validate and commit a
state change before updating the view. This guarantees that what a user sees
will never be ahead of the true state contained on the server.

User trust is a fundamental concept expressed in [simple state
propagation](/docs/concepts/simple-state-propagation).
